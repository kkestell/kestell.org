## Pizza Dough

Standard pizza dough with 70% hydration and 2.5% salt.

| Amount | Ingredient        |
| ------ | ----------------- |
| 500 g  | All-Purpose Flour |
| 360 g  | Water             |
| 15 g   | Salt              |
| 2 tsp  | Active Dry Yeast  |

## Notes

I knead this with the dough hook on my KitchenAid. Mix by hand until dough ball forms, rest 15 minutes, then knead on medium speed for 8 minutes.

Bake on a pizza stone at 550Â°F until it's done.

Makes 3 or 4 pizzas.
