# Red Lentil Soup

*Adapted from Melissa Clark's recipe in the New York Times.*

## Ingredients

- 3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for drizzling
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 tablespoon tomato paste
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- Salt and black pepper
- Pinch of Aleppo chili
- 4 cups chicken broth
- 2 cups water
- 1 cup red lentils
- 1 large carrot, peeled and diced
- Juice of 1/2 lemon
- 3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro

## Instructions

1. Sauté onion on medium low heat until they're just starting to caramelize, about 20 minutes.
2. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 3 minutes.
3. Increase heat to medium. Stir in tomato paste, cumin, 1/4 teaspoon each salt and black pepper, and Aleppo chili. Sauté for 2 minutes longer.
4. Add broth, water, lentils, and carrot. Crank the heat and bring to a simmer, then partly cover pot and reduce heat. Simmer until lentils are soft, about 20 minutes. Taste and add salt if necessary.
5. Purée half the soup using an immersion blender, then add it back to the pot. The soup should be somewhat chunky.
6. Reheat soup if necessary, then stir in lemon juice and cilantro. Serve soup drizzled with olive oil and dusted lightly with more Aleppo.
