# Toum

## Ingredients

* 1 cup garlic cloves
* 2 teaspoons kosher salt
* 3 cups neutral oil
* 1/2 cup lemon juice

## Instructions

1. Slice garlic cloves in half lengthwise, remove any green sprouts.
2. Place garlic and salt in a food processor; process until finely minced. Scrape sides as needed.
3. With processor running, add oil in slow increments (1-2 tablespoons at a time) until mixture starts to emulsify and look creamy.
4. Increase oil addition rate, alternating with lemon juice, until all incorporated; this should take about 15 minutes.
5. Transfer sauce to a glass container, cover with a paper towel, and refrigerate overnight.
6. The next day, replace paper towel with an airtight lid. Store in fridge for up to 3 months.
