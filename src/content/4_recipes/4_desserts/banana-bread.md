* 2 tsp baking soda
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1 cup walnuts

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F.

## Notes

* The original recipe called for margarine, but we like butter. Use what you prefer.
* When bananas get over-ripe, freeze them. When you have enough, thaw and make banana bread.
* This recipe also makes good cupcakes.
* Double the recipe and put some banana bread in the freezer. This freezes very well!
