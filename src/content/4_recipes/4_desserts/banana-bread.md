* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 1 1⁄2 cup flour
* 1⁄4 tsp salt
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 1⁄2 tsp baking powder

* 2 sticks butter
* 4 bananas
* 2 tsp vanilla extract
* 3 cups flour
* 1⁄2 tsp salt
* 2 tsp baking soda
* 1 tsp baking powder
* 1 cup walnuts

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F.
2. Cream together sugar, eggs, margarine, bananas, and vanilla.
3. Sift together flour, salt, baking soda, and baking powder. Add to wet ingredients.
4. Fold in walnuts.
5. Grease & flour an 8×4" loaf pan.

## Notes

* The original recipe called for margarine, but we like butter. Use what you prefer.
* When bananas get over-ripe, freeze them. When you have enough, thaw and make banana bread.
* This recipe also makes good cupcakes.
* Double the recipe and put some banana bread in the freezer. This freezes very well!
