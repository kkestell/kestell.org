| 3⁄4 cup    | Unsweetened Cocoa Powder |
| 1 1⁄2 tsp  | Baking Powder            |
| 1 1⁄2 tsp  | Baking Soda              |
| 1 tsp      | Salt                     |
| 2 tsp      | Espresso Powder          |
| 2 ea       | Eggs                     |
| 1 cup      | Milk                     |

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Spray a bundt cake pan with cooking spray.
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
3. Make a well in the middle of the dry ingredient mixture and add in the eggs, milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract. Beat for 2 minutes at medium speed, then stir in the boiling water with espresso powder. The batter will be very thin; this is normal.
4. Pour the batter into the prepared bundt pan. Bake for 35-45 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then flip it out onto a wire rack and let cool completely before serving.

### For cupcakes
