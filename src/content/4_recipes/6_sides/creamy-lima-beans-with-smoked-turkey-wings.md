| 1⁄2 lb        | Smoked Turkey Wings |
| 1⁄2 ea        | Yellow Onion        |
| 1 tbsp        | Minced Garlic       |
| 6 cups        | Chicken Stock       |

## Instructions

1. In a large stockpot over high heat, add the lima beans and about 6 cups of water. Bring to a boil, then turn off the heat and let the beans sit for 30 minutes. Drain and set aside.
2. In the same pot, add the smoked turkey wings, drained beans, and chicken stock. Bring to a simmer over medium heat.
3. Add the diced onion and minced garlic to the pot. Sprinkle in the sugar, salt, and black pepper. Stir well and cover with a lid.
4. Simmer over medium-high heat for 35 to 45 minutes, or until the beans are creamy and the meat from the turkey wings is tender and easily pulls away from the bone.
5. Remove the turkey wings, detach the meat from the bones, chop or shred it, and return it to the pot. Stir well.
6. Garnish with fresh parsley and serve either alone or over rice.
