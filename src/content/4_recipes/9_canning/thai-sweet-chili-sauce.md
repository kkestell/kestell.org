|------------------|-------------------------|
| 4 2⁄3 cups       | Water, divided          |
| 2 cups           | Rice Vinegar            |
| 2 cups           | Cider Vinegar           |
| 4 cups           | Sugar                   |
| 6 tsp            | Salt                    |
| 14 ea            | Red Chilies             |
| 2 ea             | Red Bell Peppers        |
| 1⁄2 cup          | Carrot, finely shredded |
| 12 ea            | Garlic Cloves, minced   |
| 2⁄3 cup + 3 tbsp | Clear Jel or similar    |

## Instructions

1. Seed and roughly chop chilies. Shred carrot using the second-smallest side of a box grater. Mince garlic.
2. In a medium-sized saucepan over medium to medium-high heat, combine 4 cups of water with vinegars, sugar, salt, chilies, carrot, and garlic. Stir to dissolve the sugar and salt and bring to a boil. Boil for 5 minutes.
3. Mix the starch with the remaining 2⁄3 cup of water. While stirring the sauce vigorously, pour the starch mixture into the pot. Continue stirring and bring the mixture back to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer for 1 minute.
4. Ladle the sauce into half-pint jars, leaving 1⁄4" headspace. Use a chopstick to remove air bubbles and adjust the level with additional sauce if needed. Wipe rims of jars clean with a vinegar-moistened paper towel.
5. Place lids on jars and loosely tighten rings. Use canning tongs to transfer jars to a canner or large stock pot full of boiling water, ensuring jars are covered by 2" of water. Process for 10 minutes with the canner lid on.
6. Store jars in a cool, dark place for up to 1 year. Once opened, refrigerate and use within 3 weeks.

## Notes

Makes approximately 14 half-pints.
